# Value based methods with Tile Coding as function approximation

### Algorithm(s) Implemented

Tile coding is usually your first step in the function approximation paradigm, that's why I decided to implement all the [tabular algorithms](https://github.com/BenoitLeguay/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/value_based_methods/tabular_method) using a tile coder. You'll find:

- Sarsa
- Q-Learning
- Expected Sarsa
- Sarsa($\lambda$)
